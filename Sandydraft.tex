\section{Ideas}
Current CPME model does not involve any of temporal component, which plays a key role in email interactions. Intuitively, past interaction behaviors significantly influence future ones; for example, if an actor $i$ sent an email to actor $j$, then $j$ is highly likely to send an email back to $i$ as a response (i.e. reciprocity). Moreover, the recency and frequency of past interactions can also be considered to effectively predict future interactions. Thus, as an exploratory data analysis, point process model for directional interaction is applied to the North Carolina email data. Starting from the existing framework focused on the analysis of content-partitioned subnetworks, I would suggest an extended approach to analyze the data using the timestamps in the email, aiming to develop a joint dynamic or longitudinal model of text-valued ties.\\ \newline
 CPME model is a Bayesian framework using two well-known methods: Latent Dirichlet Allocation (LDA) and Latent Space Model (LSM). Basically, existence of edge depends on topic assignment t (LDA) and its corresponding interaction pattern c. Each topic t=1,…,T has one interaction pattern c=1,…,C, and each interaction pattern posits unique latent space (LSM), thus generating $A\times A$ matrix of probabilities $P^{(c)}$ that a message author
a will include recipient $r$ on the message, given that it is about
a topic in cluster $c$.  Incorporating point process approach, now assume that under each interaction pattern, we have $A\times A$ matrix of stochastic intensities $\lambda^{(c)}(t)$ which depend on the history of interaction between the sender and receiver.

\section{CPME + Point Process Model}
Before we build up the ultimate joint model of LDA, LSM, and point process approach, we first start with simpler model which combines LDA and point process approach.
\subsection{Generative Process (From Mattew Denny)}
First we generate the global (corpus-wide) variables. There are two main sets of global variables: those that describe the
topics people talk about and those that describe how people interact (interaction patterns). These variables are linked by a
third set of variables that associate each topic with the pattern that best describes how people interact when talking about
that topic. There are T topics. Each topic $\phi^{(t)}$ is a discrete distribution over V word types \textbf{[See Algorithm 1].} There are C
interaction patterns. \\ \newline \textcolor{red}{1) Univariate Hawkes approach:} Each interaction pattern consists of a matrix of stochastic intensity $\lambda^{(c)}(t)$ that model the rate at which each sender $a$ sends email at time $t$ given all messages received by $a$ at times
$r_k^{a}< t$ ($r_k^{a}$ is the timestamp of $k^{th}$ email received by $a$)  \textbf{[See Algorithm 2].}  \\ \newline
 \textcolor{red}{2) Multivariate Hawkes approach:} Each interaction pattern consists of a matrix of stochastic intensity $\lambda^{(c)}(t)$ that model the rate at which each sender $a$ sends email at time $t$ given all messages received by $a$ at times
 	$r_k^{a}< t$ ($r_k^{a}$ is the timestamp of $k^{th}$ email received by $a$)  \textbf{[See Algorithm 3].}  \\\newline  We also associate each sender–recipient pair with an observed P-dimensional
vector of covariates $x^{(ar)}$; however, we assume that our generative process is ocnditioned on these covariates. The topics and interaction patterns are tied together via a set of T categorical variables (one per topic). These variables
associate each topic with a single interaction pattern \textbf{[See Algorithm 4].} Then, we generate the local variables. There are D
emails. We assume that each email’s sender $a^{(d)}\in [A]$, timestamp $t^{(d)} \in [0, T]$, and length $N^{(d)} \in N_0$ are observed; we do not generate these variables  \textbf{[See Algorithm 5].}

\section{Preliminary Analysis}
Hurricane Sandy was the most destructive hurricane in 2012, which hit North Carolina on late October (October 28, Governor Bev Perdue declared a state of emergency in 24 western counties due to snow and strong winds). In our dataset, there are three counties which cover the date of Hurricane Sandy (October 22, 2012 – November 2, 2012), so we focus on the three counties, since the timestamp of email in this case is much more important than usual case without any disastrous event.
