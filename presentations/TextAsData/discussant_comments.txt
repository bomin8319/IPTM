Emails: presumably the people in NC know that their emails are public
record, but Enron people didn't realize it was going to be
public. Worry about how much is actually there in email. Maybe some of
this is time-dependent? e.g., during a hurricane maybe people use the
phone. What kind of information being omitted? Is this systematic?

Should think about: who should be communicating vs. who is not
communicating with whom. When are things not operating according to
the plan? Compare to org chart -- that wasn't there.

Competition logic: everyone is raring to go, wants to send the next
email. But is this really true in government?

Email is weird in terms of length of time to reply.

What kinds of questions can we answer to this? How does it scale? Can
we apply it to other data? Citation and information
propagation. Social media shares/comments.

How does communication shift the network over time?
