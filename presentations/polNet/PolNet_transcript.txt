Slide 1.

Good afternoon, I am Bomin Kim from the statistics department of Penn state, and I will introduce my paper with great collaborators, including prof. Bruce Desmarais there, called a network model for dynamic textual communications with application to government email corpora.


Slide 2.

Our new model is called “Interaction-Partitioned Topic Model”, which I will refer to as IPTM.
IPTM is a statistical model for time-stamped textual communications, such as emails, cosponsorship of bills, or international sanctions. The model is built upon two well-known models, one is Latent Dirichlet Allocation, a model for topic-based contents where each document can be viewed as a mixture of various topics, and the second one is ERGM, the exponential random graph model, which is a family of statistical models used to analyze networks. So, IPTM is a model about “who communicates with whom about what, and when?”, and we will use LDA to model “what” and use continuous-time version of ERGM to model “who, whom and when”.


Slide 3.

First, I will introduce how the contents or the words are generated. For each topic has unique topic-word distribution phi of k, which means that topic k is characterized by a discrete distribution over the word types. Next, we assign each topic to one interaction pattern, from uniform distribution.
Now, when we create a document, we first sample a topic distribution of each document, for example in this figure, this document has topic distribution as this (highest proportion of topic 1 and topic 2, 3 follows). Then for each word, we first choose the topic from document-topic distribution theta, and then choose a word from topic-word distribution phi given the chosen topic.
